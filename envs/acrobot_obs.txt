### Description
The Acrobot environment is based on Sutton's work in
    ["Generalization in Reinforcement Learning: Successful Examples Using Sparse Coarse Coding"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1995/hash/8f1d43620bc6bb580df6e80b0dc05c48-Abstract.html)
    and [Sutton and Barto's book](http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).
    The system consists of two links connected linearly to form a chain, with one end of
    the chain fixed. The joint between the two links is actuated. The goal is to apply
    torques on the actuated joint to swing the free end of the linear chain above a
    given height while starting from the initial state of hanging downwards.

    As seen in the **Gif**: two blue links connected by two green joints. The joint in
    between the two links is actuated. The goal is to swing the free end of the outer-link
    to reach the target height (black horizontal line above system) by applying torque on
    the actuator.

### Action Space
The action is discrete, deterministic, and represents the torque applied on the actuated
    joint between the two links.

    | Num | Action                                | Unit         |
    |-----|---------------------------------------|--------------|
    | 0   | apply -1 torque to the actuated joint | torque (N m) |
    | 1   | apply 0 torque to the actuated joint  | torque (N m) |
    | 2   | apply 1 torque to the actuated joint  | torque (N m) |

### Observation Space
The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(6,)` that provides information about the
    two rotational joint angles as well as their angular velocities:

    | Num | Observation                  | Min                 | Max               |
    |-----|------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
    | 0   | Cosine of `theta1`           | -1                  | 1                 |
    | 1   | Sine of `theta1`             | -1                  | 1                 |
    | 2   | Cosine of `theta2`           | -1                  | 1                 |
    | 3   | Sine of `theta2`             | -1                  | 1                 |
    | 4   | Angular velocity of `theta1` | ~ -12.567 (-4 * pi) | ~ 12.567 (4 * pi) |
    | 5   | Angular velocity of `theta2` | ~ -28.274 (-9 * pi) | ~ 28.274 (9 * pi) |

    where
    - `theta1` is the angle of the first joint, where an angle of 0 indicates the first link is pointing directly
    downwards.
    - `theta2` is ***relative to the angle of the first link.***
        An angle of 0 corresponds to having the same angle between the two links.

    The angular velocities of `theta1` and `theta2` are bounded at ±4π, and ±9π rad/s respectively.
    A state of `[1, 0, 1, 0, ..., ...]` indicates that both links are pointing downwards.
