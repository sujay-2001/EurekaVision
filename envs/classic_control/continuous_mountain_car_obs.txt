### Description
The Mountain Car MDP is a deterministic MDP that consists of a car placed stochastically
    at the bottom of a sinusoidal valley, with the only possible actions being the accelerations
    that can be applied to the car in either direction. The goal of the MDP is to strategically
    accelerate the car to reach the goal state on top of the right hill. There are two versions
    of the mountain car domain in gym: one with discrete actions and one with continuous.
    This version is the one with continuous actions.

    This MDP first appeared in [Andrew Moore's PhD Thesis (1990)](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-209.pdf)

### Action Space
The action is a `ndarray` with shape `(1,)`, representing the directional force applied on the car.
    The action is clipped in the range `[-1,1]` and multiplied by a power of 0.0015.

### Observation Space
The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(2,)` where the elements correspond to the following:

    | Num | Observation                          | Min  | Max | Unit         |
    |-----|--------------------------------------|------|-----|--------------|
    | 0   | position of the car along the x-axis | -Inf | Inf | position (m) |
    | 1   | velocity of the car                  | -Inf | Inf | position (m) |
