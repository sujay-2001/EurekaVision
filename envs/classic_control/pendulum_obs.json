    "Description": "The inverted pendulum swingup problem is based on the classic problem in control theory. The system consists of a pendulum attached at one end to a fixed point, and the other end being free. The pendulum starts in a random position and the goal is to apply torque on the free end to swing it into an upright position, with its center of gravity right above the fixed point.",
