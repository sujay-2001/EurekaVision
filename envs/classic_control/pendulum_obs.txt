### Description
The inverted pendulum swingup problem is based on the classic problem in control theory.
    The system consists of a pendulum attached at one end to a fixed point, and the other end being free.
    The pendulum starts in a random position and the goal is to apply torque on the free end to swing it
    into an upright position, with its center of gravity right above the fixed point.

    The diagram below specifies the coordinate system used for the implementation of the pendulum's
    dynamic equations.

    -  `x-y`: cartesian coordinates of the pendulum's end in meters.
    - `theta` : angle in radians.
    - `tau`: torque in `N m`. Defined as positive _counter-clockwise_.

### Action Space
The action is a `ndarray` with shape `(1,)` representing the torque applied to free end of the pendulum.

    | Num | Action | Min  | Max |
    |-----|--------|------|-----|
    | 0   | Torque | -2.0 | 2.0 |

### Observation Space
The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(3,)` representing the x-y coordinates of the pendulum's free
    end and its angular velocity.

    | Num | Observation      | Min  | Max |
    |-----|------------------|------|-----|
    | 0   | x = cos(theta)   | -1.0 | 1.0 |
    | 1   | y = sin(theta)   | -1.0 | 1.0 |
    | 2   | Angular Velocity | -8.0 | 8.0 |
