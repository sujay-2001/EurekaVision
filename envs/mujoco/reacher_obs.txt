### Description
“Reacher” is a two-jointed robot arm.
The goal is to move the robot’s end effector (called fingertip ) close to a target that is spawned at a random position.

### Action Space
The action space is a Box(-1, 1, (2,), float32) . An action (a, b) represents the torques applied at the hinge joints.
