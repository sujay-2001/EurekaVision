### Description
This environment corresponds to the Swimmer environment described in Rémi Coulom’s PhD thesis “Reinforcement Learning Using Neural Networks, with Applications to Motor Control” .
The environment aims to increase the number of independent state and control variables compared to classical control environments.
The swimmers consist of three or more segments (’ links ’) and one less articulation joints (’ rotors ’) - one rotor joint connects exactly two links to form a linear chain.
The swimmer is suspended in a two-dimensional pool and always starts in the same position (subject to some deviation drawn from a uniform distribution),
and the goal is to move as fast as possible towards the right by applying torque to the rotors and using fluid friction.

### Action Space
The action space is a Box(-1, 1, (2,), float32) . An action represents the torques applied between links
