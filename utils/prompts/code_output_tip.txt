Your response should only contain the reward function (as provided in the reward signature) alone and not with the class definition.
The output of the reward function should consist of two items: (1) the total reward, (2) a dictionary of each individual reward component.
The code output should be formatted as a python code string: "```python ... ```".

Some helpful tips for writing the reward function code:
    (1) Make sure that you index and access the right state and action from the states, actions arrays respectively using the provided information
    (2) You can use the terminated boolean variable to know if the episode has ended or not, and assign reward accordingly
    (2) You may find it helpful to normalize the reward to a fixed range by applying transformations like np.exp to the overall reward or its components
    (3) Make sure the type of each input variable is correctly specified; 
    (4) Most importantly, the reward code should contain only input variables that are derived from the provided inputs-states, actions and terminated. Don't use any variables with self. with assimptions. Under no circumstance can you introduce new input variables.
